# HeadFirstAbstractFactoryPattern

Practising the factory design pattern from [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do). 

##  Abstract Factory Pattern
The abstract factory pattern relies on composition. It is used for creating families of related objects without having to depend on their concrete classes. The Dependency Inversion Principle guides us to avoid dependencies on concrete types and strive for abstractions (e.g. through  Java abstract or interface classes).
